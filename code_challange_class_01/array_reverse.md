# Code Challenge: Array Reverse
Reverse an array without using built-in methods

## Whiteboard Process

![Whiteboard Solution](../assets/Screenshot%20(69).png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Loop through the array from the end to the beginning and push the elements into a new array. Time complexity: O(n^2), Space complexity: O(n)

## Solution
To run the code, simply call the reverseArray function and pass an array as an argument. Examples: reverseArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]), reverseArray([89, 2354, 3546, 23, 10, -923, 823, -12])
